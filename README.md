# Git Drive
Normally we write google docs and save it in drive. Git drive is an open source self hosted platform where you can write docs and save it to a github repo instead. The docs might be saved as mark down. 

## Features
```
1. There will be a google docs like interface to write docs.
2. After writing and clicking save, the doc will be saved in a github repo as markdown.
3. You can create folders and put docs inside it. This will create a folder in github repo.
4. Interface for viewing the docs as well.
5. Edit option in the interface to edit doc on clicking save will rewrite the md in repo.
6. Options for formating the docs compatible with github markdown in the interface.
